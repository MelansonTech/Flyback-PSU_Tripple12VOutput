Project: Triple Isolated Output 120V Mains Flyback Power Supply
Overview:
This project involves the design and development of a triple isolated output flyback power supply that takes a 120V AC mains input and provides three independent, isolated DC outputs. This power supply is ideal for applications requiring multiple voltage rails from a single AC input source while maintaining galvanic isolation between the outputs for safety and reliability. The flyback converter topology ensures high efficiency, compact size, and the ability to provide multiple outputs with varying voltages and currents.

Key Features:
Input Voltage: Accepts 120V AC mains input, suitable for standard household or industrial applications.
Triple Output: Provides three isolated DC outputs with independently regulated voltages, typically used for powering various subsystems in electronic equipment.
Isolated Outputs: Each output is galvanically isolated from the others and from the input, ensuring safety and preventing interference between the outputs.
Flyback Topology: The flyback converter design offers high efficiency, simple control, and the ability to generate multiple outputs from a single transformer.
Regulated Outputs: Each output is regulated to provide a stable and consistent voltage, ensuring reliable operation of connected devices.
Compact Design: The flyback topology allows for a compact power supply design, ideal for space-constrained applications.
Safety Features: Includes over-voltage protection (OVP), over-current protection (OCP), short-circuit protection (SCP), and thermal shutdown to ensure the power supply operates safely under varying conditions.
System Components:
Input Filter: A EMI filter at the input stage ensures the power supply meets electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) standards, reducing noise and harmonics from the AC mains.
Flyback Transformer: The heart of the design, the flyback transformer, is responsible for stepping down the voltage and providing isolation between the input and output rails.
Primary Side Control: The primary side control regulates the output voltages by adjusting the duty cycle of the switch. This reduces the need for optocouplers or secondary-side feedback, simplifying the design.
Rectification & Filtering: Each output is rectified and filtered using diodes and capacitors to provide smooth and stable DC voltages.
Regulation Circuit: Feedback control mechanisms ensure that the output voltages are regulated and stay within their specified tolerance limits.
Output Protection: Each output has overvoltage and overcurrent protection to safeguard the load and power supply.
Output Specifications (Example):
Output 1: +12V DC @ 2A
Output 2: +5V DC @ 3A
Output 3: +15V DC @ 1A
Working Principle:
AC Input: The AC mains voltage (120V AC) is rectified and filtered to provide a stable DC input voltage for the flyback converter.

Flyback Converter Operation: The flyback transformer stores energy in its magnetic field during the switch-on period and releases it to the output during the switch-off period. The design uses primary-side regulation, which adjusts the switching duty cycle to maintain a stable output voltage without the need for a secondary-side feedback loop.

Voltage Regulation: The converter ensures each output is regulated to the required voltage using feedback from the primary side. This regulation maintains constant output voltage despite variations in load or input voltage.

Isolation: Each of the three outputs is electrically isolated from the others and from the input using the flyback transformer. This isolation ensures safety and prevents electrical noise or faults from propagating across the outputs.

Protection Features: The power supply incorporates overvoltage and overcurrent protections for each output, ensuring that the load is not exposed to dangerous conditions. Thermal shutdown protects the unit from excessive heating during heavy load conditions.

Design Considerations:
Efficiency: The flyback converter is designed to achieve high efficiency, minimizing energy loss and heat generation.
Compactness: The design focuses on a compact form factor while maintaining performance, making it suitable for space-constrained applications.
Safety and Compliance: The power supply meets international safety standards, such as UL and CE, to ensure safe operation in a wide range of environments.
Thermal Management: Active or passive cooling is employed to manage heat dissipation, especially when the load demands significant power.
Conclusion:
The Triple Isolated Output 120V Mains Flyback Power Supply is an efficient, reliable solution for applications requiring multiple isolated DC outputs from a single AC mains input. With a compact design, built-in protection features, and the ability to deliver stable, regulated voltages, this power supply is ideal for a range of industrial, medical, and consumer electronics applications. The flyback topology ensures high efficiency, making it a versatile choice for powering systems where safety, space, and efficiency are critical.
